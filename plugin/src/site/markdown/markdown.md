## Markdown

It is good practice to have this file,
with minimal description of your project (usually called README). 
Ruby, then GitHub and Node.js have adopted README.md as default.

`.md` or `.markdown` are file with text in markdown format.
Markdown is markup language, a superset of HTML, with focus on content authoring (not design).
